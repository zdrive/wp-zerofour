# WP-ZeroFour

WP-ZeroFour is a WordPress adaptation of of the responsive HTML template ZeroFour (v2.5) originally by @n33co (CC3.0 by; [html5up.net](http://html5up.net/)).

The initial conversion from HTML5 to WordPress was performed in 2014 by [thequicksilver](https://github.com/thequicksilver/). I forked the project to take on an easy task for my first GitHub project repository. This implentation includes bug fixes and enhancements.

There is a working demo here: http://www.west-la.info/

A responsive blog/magazine site template design named as such because it's the fourth design up here (very creative I know). Has plenty of room for all sorts of content and even multilevel drop down menus.

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)
